        <h1>Frankfurt School</h1>
        <p>This section describes Gretel Adorno's involvement in the Frankfurt School of philosophy, focusing on her contributions to three key texts.</p>
        <p>Much of Gretel's documented contribution was through stenography and secretarial work, though it should be noted she was also involved in substantial editorial work, especially on <MadCap:xref href="aesthetic-theory.htm">Aesthetic Theory</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h2>Extent of Gretel's role</h2>
        <p>It is hard to evaluate Gretel Adorno's overall contribution to the Frankfurt School, and her husband's work. She was certainly more than 'just' a typist: she was present at during the discussions between Adorno and Horkheimer, taking the notes that produced <MadCap:xref href="dialectic-enlightenment.htm">The Dialectic of Enlightenment</MadCap:xref>. Was she a silent note-taker, or an active participant? Is it credible that a woman who engaged in extensive intellectual correspondence with Walter Benjamin had nothing to say during these discussions? Her editorial role completing <MadCap:xref href="aesthetic-theory.htm">Aesthetic Theory</MadCap:xref> after Adorno's death suggests active contribution and engagement with the ideas of the Frankfurt School. </p>
