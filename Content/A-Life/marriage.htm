        <p>Gretel married Theodor Adorno in 1937, after 14 years of courtship, much of it long distance. It seems the lengthy separation caused long-term emotional strain on her, according to her letters with the Adornos' close friend, Walter Benjamin.</p>
        <p>Theodor Adorno had several affairs, which Gretel was presumably aware of: Theodor wrote about them in his diary and letters, which Gretel was involved in typing up. </p>
        <p>Gretel was widowed in 1969.</p>
